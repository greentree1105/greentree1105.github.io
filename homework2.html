    <h2>Stanford researchers find a quicker,<br>cheaper way to sort isotopes<br></h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">BY EMMANUEL ROMERO L.A.Ciero Richard Zre
        Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer grass that tickles your
        feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate, nearly every part of the world around
        you carries special chemical markers These markers, called isotopes, can tell scientists where the
        molecules that compose a substance are from, where they traveled and what happened to them
        along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex and costly. Now,Stanford chemists have
        developed a new method to make isotopic analysis earier and less expensive.</p>
